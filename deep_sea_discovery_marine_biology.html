            <h2 id="title1" style="color: #03045e;">Epipelagic Zone (The Sunlight Zone)</h2>
            <p>The Sunlight Zone (Epipelagic Zone) runs from the surface of the ocean down to nearly 200 meters. This zone has sunlight and photosynthesis occurs, so this is a highly populated area in which many 
                compounds exist. For example, phytoplankton exists below the detection range as the lowest level of the food web, and many sea life such as dolphins, sharks, and more commonplace fishes occupy this 
                zone. This is where temperatures are accommodating and depths serve as primary production for other webs. Thus, to understand the oceans, one needs to understand this zone.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="mesopelagic" class="info">
            <h2 id="title1" style="color: #03045e;">Mesopelagic Zone (The Twilight Zone)</h2>
            <p>The Mesopelagic Zone - also known as the Twilight Zone - exists between 200 and 1,000 meters. It's relatively dark, as sunlight does not penetrate so deeply, and no photosynthesis occurs, which implies 
                that creatures like squid, <a id="fish" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanternfish">lanternfish</a>, and other bioluminescent beings are accustomed to the darkness and intense pressures. These animals are very resilient, and they tend to travel to the Sunlight
                 Zone above for feeding during the night and return as they spawn during the daytime hours. In terms of carbon cycling, it's relative to how deep this zone is that organic matter falls, and it gets 
                 eaten down here.</p>

        <div id="bathypelagic" class="info">

            <p>The Bathypelagic Zone—Midnight Zone—extends from 1,000 to 4,000 meters. This is the dark zone of no light. Chilly temperatures and high pressure mean that life is limited here (<a id="fish" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_squid">giant squid</a>, 
                <a id="fish" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglerfish">anglerfish</a>, and specific jellyfish are found even deeper) but those that make this zone their home include. Communication and feeding depend upon luminescence as so many creatures possess this 
                feature. This zone is part of the deep-sea carbon sink as it gains organic material from above.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="abyssopelagic" class="info">
            <h2 id="title1" style="color: #03045e;">Abyssopelagic Zone (The Abyss)</h2>
            <p>The Abyssopelagic Zone (Abyss) extends from 4,000 to 6,000 meters. Cold temperatures just above freezing, immense pressure, and complete darkness characterize this zone. Compared to other areas of 
                the ocean, there is not a lot of life here, and what can survive in these conditions is highly specialized. For instance, the deep sea <a id="fish" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglerfish">anglerfish</a>, specific varieties of <a id="fish" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimpoteuthis">abyssal octupus</a>, and a few 
                <a id="fish" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echinoderm">echinoderms</a> thrive in this area. The ocean floor consists of an abyssal plain, a mostly flat region topped with silt-like sediments. This zone is one of the most inhospitable places on the planet.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="hadal" class="info">
            <h2 id="title1" style="color: #03045e;">Hadal Zone (The Trenches)</h2>
            <p>The Hadalpelagic Zone encompasses the deepest parts of the ocean, starting underneath 6000 m. This includes the Mariana Trench. With unimaginative pressure, frigid temperatures, and complete darkness, 
                creatures that call this zone home include <a id="fish" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphipoda">amphipods</a>, <a id="fish" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polychaete">polychaete worms</a>, and <a id="fish" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophyophorea">xenophyophores</a>. 
                They exist in very specific forms for survival. This is the least explored zone of the ocean. Exploration of this zone helps scientists understand the possibilities of life in the most extreme situations.</p>

                Great Barrier Reef, offer unique ecosystems and protection for marine life. They often occur in deeper tropical and subtropical waters.</p>

            <p id="OLp2">Atolls form from coral reefs growing around a volcanic island. As the island sinks or erodes, coral growth keeps pace with the descent, 
                creating a ring-shaped structure with a central lagoon. Atolls are found mainly in tropical regions of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, famous atolls include those in the Maldives and Marshall Islands.</p>

                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Marine Snow:</span> This is the continuous shower of mainly organic detritus falling from the upper layers of the water column. Marine microbes colonise 
                            these particles, breaking down complex organic molecules, which makes the nutrients available to other organisms including filter feeders and scavengers.</p>

                            <span style="font-weight:bold">Microbial Loops:</span>  Bacteria and other microorganisms decompose organic matter, releasing back nutrients (like nitrogen and phosphorus) into the water, 
                            which are recycled by phytoplankton and other primary producers; this nutrient loop is helpful to maintain productivity in oligotrophic waters that are normally starved of high nutrient 
                            availability.</p>

                        <p>Some marine microbes can be pathogenic, affecting larger marine organisms. For example, certain vibrio species can cause disease in fish, shellfish, and even humans. Pathogenic microbes 
                            can influence population dynamics and ecosystem health by causing disease outbreaks.</p>

                        <p> Marine microbial communities are incredibly complex, with thousands of different species interacting in ways that are yet to be fully understood. Developing models that accurately 
                            represent these interactions is a major challenge.</p>

                        <p> Protecting marine microbial diversity is crucial for maintaining the health of the ocean and its ability to regulate global climate. Conservation efforts must consider the roles of 
                            microbes in maintaining ecosystem services.</p>
